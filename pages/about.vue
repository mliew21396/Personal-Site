      <p>
        I am a software engineer who started in cancer research, switched to healthcare quality assurance, and now have fully transitioned to software development. Whether Iâ€™m experimenting at the limits of science or improving software quality, one thing has remained the same - my joy in finding programming solutions to complex problems. I want to take my research and problem solving skills to the next level and impact the development world by creating efficient and elegant products.
